{"name":"UFVR-Project-2","tagline":"American pilgrimage scene built using Unity3D.","body":"## Project Description \r\nOur scene is a VR experience taking place during the Westward expansion of the 1800s. The user is given a glimpse of life on the Oregon Trail, riding by wagon with a small group of travelers.\r\n\r\n### Learning Objective \r\nAfter the VR experience, participants will have a deeper understanding of the hardship and sacrifices made by travelers on the Oregon Trail.\r\n\r\n### Elements of Presence\r\nMany elements in this project were designed to increase the user's sense of presence. These major elements included:\r\n- First-Person Character View: Allowing the user to see his/her own body rather than being a floating camera\r\n\r\n- Dialogue: The time-specific dialogue gives the user some historical insight and introduces the setting\r\n\r\n- Ambient Sounds: The combination of background noises (wind, horses, wagons)\r\n\r\n### Environment Design\r\nThe scene's environment was inspired by many concepts described in the VR Book. The most significant of these are as follows:\r\n- Background: The terrain extends in all directions to each horizon until it meets the night sky. This scenery exists at every point in the scene.\r\n\r\n- Fundamental Geometry: Complementing the distant terrain, the scene's path has been scattered with trees, bushes and smaller hills. All of these have natural physics and colliders to add a closer sense of presence.\r\n\r\n- Interactive Objects: Throughout the path there are also movable pieces of terrain. They can only be interacted with by the main user (not other NPCs) and are central to the story.\r\n\r\n- Color and Lighting: The lighting implemented is bright enough to allow the user to see all the models in the scene, yet it is dark enough to maintain the feel of a night sky.\r\n\r\n- Audio: As mentioned earlier, the ambient noise and dialogue keep the user fully involved with the environment.\r\n\r\n- Environmental Wayfinding: The entire scene takes place on a one-way path and moves in one direction. This simply eliminates the need for any artificial wayfinders or visual aids.\r\n\r\n### Assets & Models\r\nHere is a list physical of elements we used to build the scene (with the package and developer if imported):\r\n- Terrain (Original): Built using the Unity Terrain Editor\r\n- Sand Texture: \"Free Sand Materials\" - Nobiax/Yughues\r\n- Trees & Bushes: \"Free Desert Plants\" - Lemuria\r\n- Human Characters:\r\n- Character Animations:\r\n- Wagon (Original): Built using Maya\r\n- Horses (and Animation):\r\n- Crates & Miscellaneous Materials:\r\n- Night Sky:\r\n\r\nAnd here is a list of the auditory elements in the scene (with the package and developer if imported):\r\n- Dialogue (Original): Written and recorded by us\r\n- Background Noise: \"Windy Coyote Desert Night\" - Sleep Relaxation Ambient Sounds\r\n- Horse Sounds:\r\n- Wagon Sounds:\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- [YouTube Video](TODO)\r\n- [Download Project Package](TODO)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
