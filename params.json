{"name":"UFVR Project Two","tagline":"American pilgrimage scene built using Unity3D.","body":"## Project Description & Motivation\r\nOur scene is a VR experience taking place during the Westward expansion of the 1800's. The user is given a glimpse of life on the Oregon Trail, riding by wagon through a desert environment. The scene begins with a couple minutes of dialogue, followed by the death of one the passengers.\r\n\r\nThe motivation from this project stems from the general perception of 1800's Westward Expansion. Most teachings of the major migrations such as the Oregon Trail tend to focus on the achievement and accomplishments of the travelers rather than the hardship they put themselves through to explore new regions of the continent. Our team researched the technical details needed to build the scene, such as the environments traveled, the methods of transportation and general details of the era to create an original dialogue. All of these elements helped create our 1800's Oregon Trail scene.\r\n\r\nWe chose the Oregon Trail because it served as one of the most important migrations of the time. It covered the region of what is currently eight states: Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon. But most importantly, it helped the nation fulfill its cultural goal of Manifest Destiny; that is, that the new settlers of America were destined to expand and settle from coast to coast.\r\n\r\n### Learning Objective \r\nAfter the VR experience, participants will have a deeper understanding of the hardship and sacrifices made by travelers on the Oregon Trail.\r\n\r\n### Elements of Presence\r\nMany elements in this project were designed to increase the user's sense of presence. These major elements included:\r\n- First-Person Character View: Allowing the user to see his/her own body rather than being a floating camera\r\n\r\n- Dialogue: The time-specific dialogue gives the user some historical insight and introduces the setting\r\n\r\n- Ambient Sounds: The combination of background noises (wind, horses, wagons)\r\n\r\n### Environment Design\r\nThe scene's environment was inspired by many concepts described in the VR Book. The most significant of these are as follows:\r\n- Background: The terrain extends in all directions to each horizon until it meets the night sky. This scenery exists at every point in the scene.\r\n\r\n- Fundamental Geometry: Complementing the distant terrain, the scene's path has been scattered with trees, bushes and smaller hills. All of these have natural physics and colliders to add a closer sense of presence.\r\n\r\n- Interactive Objects: Throughout the path there are also movable pieces of terrain. They can only be interacted with by the main user (not other NPCs) and are central to the story.\r\n\r\n- Color and Lighting: The lighting implemented is bright enough to allow the user to see all the models in the scene, yet it is dark enough to maintain the feel of a night sky.\r\n\r\n- Audio: As mentioned earlier, the ambient noise and dialogue keep the user fully involved with the environment.\r\n\r\n- Environmental Wayfinding: The entire scene takes place on a one-way path and moves in one direction. This simply eliminates the need for any artificial wayfinders or visual aids.\r\n\r\n### Assets & Models\r\nHere is a list physical of elements we used to build the scene (with the package and developer if imported):\r\n- Terrain (Original): Built using the Unity Terrain Editor\r\n- Sand Texture: \"Free Sand Materials\" - Nobiax/Yughues\r\n- Trees & Bushes: \"Free Desert Plants\" - Lemuria\r\n- Human Models (Original): Built using the Autodesk Character Generator\r\n- Human Animations (Original): Built using Mixamo\r\n- Wagon (Original): Built using Maya\r\n- Horses: http://www.orangefreesounds.com/walking-horse-carriage/ \r\n- Crates & Miscellaneous Materials: \"Pro Western Starting Pack\" - Tamarin Studios\r\n- Night Sky: \"Sky5X One\" - RKD\r\n\r\nAnd here is a list of the auditory elements in the scene (with the package and developer if imported):\r\n- Dialogue (Original): Written and recorded by us, inspired by: http://www.historynet.com/oregon-trail\r\n- Background Noise: \"Windy Coyote Desert Night\" - Sleep Relaxation Ambient Sounds\r\n- Horse & Wagon Sounds: http://www.orangefreesounds.com/walking-horse-carriage/\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n- [YouTube Video](TODO)\r\n- [Download Project Package](TODO)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
