<p>Our scene is a VR experience taking place during the Westward expansion of the 1800s. The user is given a glimpse of life on the Oregon Trail, riding by wagon with a small group of travelers.</p>

<h3>
<a id="learning-objective" class="anchor" href="#learning-objective" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Learning Objective</h3>

<p>After the VR experience, participants will have a deeper understanding of the hardship and sacrifices made by travelers on the Oregon Trail.</p>

<a id="elements-of-presence" class="anchor" href="#elements-of-presence" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Elements of Presence</h3>

<p>Many elements in this project were designed to increase the user's sense of presence. These major elements included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First-Person Character View: Allowing the user to see his/her own body rather than being a floating camera</p></li>
<li><p>Dialogue: The time-specific dialogue gives the user some historical insight and introduces the setting</p></li>
<li><p>Ambient Sounds: The combination of background noises (wind, horses, wagons)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="environment-design" class="anchor" href="#environment-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment Design</h3>

<p>The scene's environment was inspired by many concepts described in the VR Book. The most significant of these are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Background: The terrain extends in all directions to each horizon until it meets the night sky. This scenery exists at every point in the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Fundamental Geometry: Complementing the distant terrain, the scene's path has been scattered with trees, bushes and smaller hills. All of these have natural physics and colliders to add a closer sense of presence.</p></li>
<li><p>Interactive Objects: Throughout the path there are also movable pieces of terrain. They can only be interacted with by the main user (not other NPCs) and are central to the story.</p></li>
<li><p>Color and Lighting: The lighting implemented is bright enough to allow the user to see all the models in the scene, yet it is dark enough to maintain the feel of a night sky.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio: As mentioned earlier, the ambient noise and dialogue keep the user fully involved with the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Environmental Wayfinding: The entire scene takes place on a one-way path and moves in one direction. This simply eliminates the need for any artificial wayfinders or visual aids.</p></li>
</ul>
