<p>Our scene is a VR experience taking place during the Westward expansion of the 1800's. The user is given a glimpse of life on the Oregon Trail, riding by wagon through a desert environment. The scene begins with a couple minutes of dialogue, followed by the death of one the passengers.</p>

<p>The motivation from this project stems from the general perception of 1800's Westward Expansion. Most teachings of the major migrations such as the Oregon Trail tend to focus on the achievement and accomplishments of the travelers rather than the hardship they put themselves through to explore new regions of the continent. Our team researched </p>

<p>After the VR experience, participants will have a deeper understanding of the hardship and sacrifices made by travelers on the Oregon Trail.</p>

<a id="elements-of-presence" class="anchor" href="#elements-of-presence" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Elements of Presence</h3>

<p>Many elements in this project were designed to increase the user's sense of presence. These major elements included:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First-Person Character View: Allowing the user to see his/her own body rather than being a floating camera</p></li>
<li><p>Dialogue: The time-specific dialogue gives the user some historical insight and introduces the setting</p></li>
<li><p>Ambient Sounds: The combination of background noises (wind, horses, wagons)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="environment-design" class="anchor" href="#environment-design" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environment Design</h3>

<p>The scene's environment was inspired by many concepts described in the VR Book. The most significant of these are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Background: The terrain extends in all directions to each horizon until it meets the night sky. This scenery exists at every point in the scene.</p></li>
<li><p>Fundamental Geometry: Complementing the distant terrain, the scene's path has been scattered with trees, bushes and smaller hills. All of these have natural physics and colliders to add a closer sense of presence.</p></li>
<li><p>Interactive Objects: Throughout the path there are also movable pieces of terrain. They can only be interacted with by the main user (not other NPCs) and are central to the story.</p></li>
<li><p>Color and Lighting: The lighting implemented is bright enough to allow the user to see all the models in the scene, yet it is dark enough to maintain the feel of a night sky.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio: As mentioned earlier, the ambient noise and dialogue keep the user fully involved with the environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Environmental Wayfinding: The entire scene takes place on a one-way path and moves in one direction. This simply eliminates the need for any artificial wayfinders or visual aids.</p></li>
</ul>
